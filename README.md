This is a replication of the "Where Is Waldo" game.
The user will make selections for each character and they will get feedback on whether they are correct or not.
At the end of the game the user will be asked to input his name in order to store his highscore in the database.

The project is build from scratch using HTML CSS and JS for the frontend for the user interaction and the backend is built with Firebase.
The coordinates locations and the scoreborad are stored in the backed. The website is hosted on the Firebase Hosting Services.
